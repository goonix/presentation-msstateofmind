## What is MS?

Clinically - a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

And we're done, right?! <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" -->

## Not really
It's actually as clear as the "cog fog" <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-left" -->

Note:
When we talk about cognitive fog later this joke will make more sense - which is better than most of my jokes.

## What is it then?

- A disease in which the immune system attacks nerve fibers and protective myelin in the brain and spinal cord <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Unpredictable<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Cause unknown<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Each case as unique as the individual afflicted<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - with some commonalities

Note:
- In many ways, it's like an undirected hyperactive immune system that eats itself
- Being unique to each patient, it can add to a delay in diagnosis or even an initial misdiagnosis

Outro - So let's get some basics out of the way..

## My lan?

Uh.. no <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## What's myelin then?

It's basically a protective sheath around the nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord.

Note:
- Healthy nerve
- describe how electrical impulses normally move quickly at the myelin edges

- This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells.
- Can kind of think of it as packetized information

Myelin is an insulating layer, or sheath that forms around nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord. It is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells. If myelin is damaged, these impulses slow down.
