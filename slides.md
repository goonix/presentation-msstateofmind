## What is MS?

Clinically - a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

And we're done, right?! <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" -->

## Not really
It's actually as clear as the "cog fog" <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-left" -->

Note:
When we talk about cognitive fog later this joke will make more sense - which is better than most of my jokes.

---

## What is it then?

- A disease in which the immune system attacks nerve fibers and protective myelin in the brain and spinal cord <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Unpredictable<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Cause unknown<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Each case as unique as the individual afflicted<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - with some commonalities

Note:
- In many ways, it's like an undirected hyperactive immune system that eats itself
- Being unique to each patient, it can add to a delay in diagnosis or even an initial misdiagnosis

Outro - So let's get some basics out of the way..
