# Intro

It's an unseasonably warm late November fall. The chill of an overnight freeze greets you as you open the back door and let your best four-legged friend out ahead of you on his leash. As you start the second trip around the house a gust of wind strikes up and you pull your coat a little closer - guess you should've put the gloves on anyway..

As you approach the side of the house his agility masks his age <16 years> as he hops up onto the low tie wall - seemingly proud of himself. As you get to the edge of the ties your foot slips on the slope of the embankment and you don't fall, but rather lie down at a 45 degree angle rather abruptly. As you lie there you look up and see him grinning, "Keep up old man."

By the time you get back inside you've decided it's a little too early for a Friday morning and curl up inside a comforter and fall asleep. Some time later you're not sure if you're still dreaming or awake because through your grogginess you realize you can't move. You'd be terrified if it weren't for your addled brain pulling you back into the dark security of sleep.

It's late morning when you awake again and you think, "What a messed up dream." as you clumsily sit up and swing your legs over the edge of the bed. As soon as you stand up you realize something isn't right. You start to lose your balance and thankfully fall back to sit on the bed. You're first thought is that your leg was asleep, but as you sit there trying to massage feeling back into it you realize you've no feeling in your hand, arm, or anywhere on the right side of your body. Maybe it wasn't a dream..

The next couple of months are a blur as you have an MRI and see a specialist at the behest of your doctor. As the specialist confirms the diagnosis, you're thankful because while reading and preparing for this day, you learned many people had to struggle for years for a proper diagnosis, or fighting to even be heard. But today you've a name for this new addition to your life - Multiple Sclerosis, or commonly MS. Now you have to learn what that means, and navigate the changes it brings.


## start into slides, "so, what is MS?"

Fell 11/23/2012? Day after thanksgiving?

Diagnosed 1/9/2013

Rebif injections 3 times a week
Copaxone injections every other day
A pill that lasted just a few months - not fun
Ocrevus - since 2015 or 2016

## What is MS?

Clinically - a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

And we're done, right?! <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-down" -->

---

## Not really
It's actually as clear as the "cog fog" <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-left" -->

Note:
When we talk about cognitive fog later this joke will make more sense - which is better than most of my jokes.

---

## What is it then?

- A disease in which the immune system attacks nerve fibers and protective myelin in the brain and spinal cord <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Unpredictable<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Cause unknown<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Data shows there may be a link to environment/geography, genetics, but there hasn't been a single common thread. Although I believe they're getting closer to it. (Epstein Barr virus)
- Each case as unique as the individual afflicted<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - with some commonalities

Note:
- In many ways, it's like an undirected hyperactive immune system that eats itself
- Being unique to each patient, it can add to a delay in diagnosis or even an initial misdiagnosis

Outro - So let's get some basics out of the way..

## My lan?
![myLan](images/lan-small.png)

Uh.. no <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

------

## What's myelin then?

It's basically a protective sheath around the nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord.

![myelin-normal](drawings/axon-healthy.png) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Healthy nerve
- describe how electrical impulses normally move quickly at the myelin edges

- This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells.
- Can kind of think of it as packetized information

Myelin is an insulating layer, or sheath that forms around nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord. It is made up of protein and fatty substances. This myelin sheath allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells. If myelin is damaged, these impulses slow down.

------

## Demyelination

![myelin-demyelination](drawings/axon-demylenization.png)
(Omaha's post-winter roads ;) )

Note:
Create lesions when destroyed and can lead to an exacerbation.
- an increase in existing or new symptoms
- the lesions is how MS gets its name (multiple scars)
When damaged, the speed at which electrical impulses can travel slows down
 - the jump points are unknown
   - it's sort of like never knowing the size of a packet
 - so have to take the longer route through the nerve itself
   - can be thought of like a synchronous, blocked transmission with multiple ACKs and checksums and resends

------

## Nerve Damage

![myelin-nerve-damage](drawings/axon-nervedamage.png)

Note:
Damage is servere and the brain needs to figure out another route altogether.
- can lead to permanent loss of function

Outro - Now that we know what is does, how does it manifest?

---

## Symptoms

Why is it called "a" symptomatic if you don't have symptoms? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- Because if you did have symptoms you would "b" symptomatic! ðŸ™ƒ -->
Because if you did have symptoms you would "b" symptomatic! &#x1F643; <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

------

## Fatigue

![center](drawings/fatigue.png)

Note:
- Fatigue - #1 symptom
 - Regardless of how much sleep one gets

------

## Numbness

![center](drawings/numbness.png)

Note:
- Numbness

------

## Tingling

![center](drawings/tingling.png)

Note:
- Tingling
 - Can feel like your skin is crawling

------

## Spasticity

![center](drawings/tremors.png)

Note:
- Two forms
 - Tremors - rapid spastic muscle contractions
 - Tightness - muscle "feels better" contracted
- Spasticity
 - Tremors
  - "twitchy" muscles that can move in an erratic manner
 - Tightness
  - muscles so tight can become locked in a bent (flexor spasticity) or extended (extensor spasticity) position and difficult to move

------

#### Blurred, Double, or Loss of Vision

![center](drawings/blurred-vision.png)

Note:
- adlib

------

## Cog Fog

![center](drawings/cog-fog.png)

Note:
- Cog Fog: Cognitive impairment occurs in 40-65% patients
 - memory loss, disorientation, and mental sluggishness/concentration, information processing, spacial/visual processing
 - made worse by stress and exhaustion

------

## Many others

- Weakness
- Dropped foot
- Loss of motor functions
- &#x221E;

Note:
- Important to note
- Each characteristic can enhance or conflate another symptom
 - ex. fatigue often increases numbness, spasticity

## Long and winding road

Note:
Having MS is a long and winding road..

---

## 4 Courses of the disease:
- Relapsing-Remitting (RRMS)
- Primary Progressive (PPMS)
- Secondary Progressive (SPMS)
- Benign

Note:
As I said before, MS is different for every person, but there are 4 main courses or classifications of the disease.

------

## RRMS

![RRMS](drawings/rrms.png) <!-- .element width="575px" -->

Note:
- Relapsing-Remitting
 - At the time of diagnosis 80 - 90% of people will have RRMS
 - symptoms persist for a period of time, and then disappear partially or completely as it enters temporary remission leaving the person without new symptoms for weeks, months, even years
 - In time, an exacerbation can happen that causes a relapse
  - sometimes previous symptoms, sometimes new fun

------

## PPMS

![PPMS](drawings/ppms.png)<!-- .element width="575px" -->

Note:
- Primary Progressive
 - 10 - 15% of people
 - gradually worsens from the start
 - generally has worst impact on mobility

------

## SPMS

<!-- ![w:575px center](drawings/spms.png) -->
<!-- ![](drawings/spms.png)  .element height="50%" width="50%" -->
![SPMS](drawings/spms.png) <!-- .element width="575px" -->

Note:
- Secondary Progressive
 - Sort of a pseudo-type
 - Originally diagnosed with RRMS
 - if no discernable remission and symptoms accumulate or worsen

------

## Benign

![Benign](drawings/benign.png) <!-- .element width="375px" -->

Note:
- Benign
 - 5 - 10% of people
 - Mild course
 - No evidence of worsening after 15 years

---

### Where does that leave us?

![w:490px center](images/DrManhattanNervousSystem.gif) <!-- .element: class="fragment" width="490px" -->

Note:
1. So, where does that leave us?
2. Sometimes, reduced to a bundle of nerves.

---

### Really though

  Just one day at a time..<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  <fragment>like everyone else. &#128522; &#x1F60A;<!-- .element: class="fragment" --></fragment>

Note:
1. Although the cause is unknown and there isn't currently a cure, new therapies are being developed that help reduce and stave off the progression in some cases. But a true cure is at least 10 - 15 years off.
2. Finish out with "MS is an invisible disease. You don't see it, but someone you know may live with it.

## Base Slide

Yep, something should be here...

Now, where did it go?! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Some helpful notes would likely be.. helpful.
- Formatting is useful too!
